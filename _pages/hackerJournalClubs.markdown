*ON TWITCH AND THE DISCORD*

AI Security moves very quickly and is closely linked to the academic community. 
To keep up with the field one has to read papers and talk about them. 

This is a Hacker Journal Club, the panels consist of people with industry experience and we focus on how the papers apply to the real world.

## Hacker Journal Club
*WEDNESDAY AT 5 PM PST / 8 PM EST*

We discuss any paper that the AIV community is interested in at this Journal Club. Paper’s we’ve covered extend from Magic The Gathering is Turing Complete, to KiloGrams: Very Large N-Grams for Malware Classification, from Adversarial Machine Learning -- Industry Perspectives to the first ML CVE. 

We regularly talk about policy, red-teaming, blue-teaming, research, math, ethics and whatever else the community wants. 

## Privacy & Ethics in ML Journal Club
*TUESDAY AT 5 PM PST / 8 PM EST*

Despite the increasing usage of artificial intelligence in critical applications, these systems are vulnerable to a plethora of failure models with regards to integrity, availability, confidentiality, fairness, and other requirements. We plan to analyze these systems in an interdisciplinary manner, analyzing different works in this field from both theoretical and practical perspectives.
