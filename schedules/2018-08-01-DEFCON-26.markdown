## Accepted Talks

#### The current state of adversarial machine learning

_infosecanon_

Machine learning is quickly becoming a ubiquitous technology in the computer security space, but how secure is it exactly? This talk covers the research occurring in adversarial machine learning and includes a discussion of machine learning blind spots, adversarial examples and how they are generated, and current blackbox testing techniques.

#### StuxNNet: Practical Live Memory Attacks on Machine Learning Systems

_Raphael Norwitz_

Like all software systems, the execution of machine learning models is dicated by logic represented as data in memory. Unlike traditional software, machine learning systems' behavior depends less on precise machine opcodes and more on weight vectors and bias parameters. In terms of possible threat models this makes a huge difference: an attacker cannot arbitrarily perturb the program code of a typical executable and have it run error free, however these weight and bias values can be scrambled arbitrarily without any risk of causing a crash. With selective retraining and backpropogation, we demonstrate how one can easily retrain networks to behave completely differently or respond predictably to certain triggers. Thus an attacker looking to compromise an ML system can simply patch these values in live memory, thereby taking control of system with minimal risk of system malfunctions or other detectable side-effects. In this talk, we demonstrate proof of concept malware to attack Neural Networks on Windows 7 and discuss different training paradigms we've used. In particular, we focus on minimizing the size of the patch needed to change the model's behavior, to prove an attack with realistic bounds on network communication. We hope that seeing our malware run against various different frameworks, and showcasing devastating potential of a patched network will provide valuable insight into the mechanisms tomorrow's hackers could use, and spark a discussion around systems level AI security.

#### Holy BATSense! Deploying TBATS Machine Learning Algorithm to Detect Security Events

_Pranshu Bajpai_

Our “BATSense” security event detection methodology has been running at Michigan State University’s campus for a year and is successfully detecting security anomalies across 300k devices. In this presentation, we will describe the use machine learning, specifically the TBATS forecasting algorithm, to predict future trends for the number of events per second for a variety of device types. The forecasted values are compared against actual observations to alert security personnel of significant deviations. Anomalies are detected based on logs relevant to security events; they may be system modifications, system failures or a football game. Forecasts are never perfect, but when measured over extended use, we have shown that false positives are manageable (1 per week) for true positives of 1 per day. The result a methodology that has been developed and tweaked over time to effectively detect security events, and lessons learned over a year. All arguments presented in this talk will be backed by real world (anonymized) data collected at our university shared with the audience.

#### Detecting Web Attacks with Recurrent Neural Networks

_Fedor Sakharov_

"Classic Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) mostly use rule-based approach for attack detection. This approach is known to have its pros and cons. Despite offering decent protection from automated attacks and predictable detection results rule-based approach has and always will have certain disadvantages. We all know that it's useless against 0-day attacks or that even the most sophisticated rules are easily evaded by skilled professionals. That is why a more effective approach should involve some kind of heuristics. Let's give a chance to artificial intelligence to find something non-obvious for human perception in raw data and try to explain its results.

To this day AI has been more often used for cat classification rather than for detecting application-level attacks on HTTP applications. Our team decided to test the hypothesis that Deep Learning is able to detect web-based attacks effectively. We started with very simple neural network architectures and tried to use them for classification. After some experiments it became clear that we needed more complex networks so we abandoned our attempts to use classification shifting to anomaly detection. Eventually, we ended up using seq2seq model with attention mechanisms which is able to detect zero-day web attacks with minimal number of false positives."

#### It’s a Beautiful Day in the Malware Neighborhood

_Matt_

"Malware similarity analysis compares and identifies samples with shared static or behavioral characteristics. Identification of similar malware samples provides analysts with more context during triage and malware analysis. Most domain approaches to malware similarity have focused on fuzzy hashing, locality sensitivity hashing, and other approximate matching methods that index a malware corpus on structural features and raw bytes. Ssdeep or sdhash are often utilized for similarity comparison despite known weaknesses and limitations. Signatures and IOCs are generated from static and dynamic analysis to capture features and matched against unknown samples. Incident management systems (RTIR, FIR) store contextual features, e.g. environment, device, and user metadata, which are used to catalog specific sample groups observed.

In the data mining and machine learning communities, the nearest neighbor search (NN) task takes an input query represented as a feature vector and returns the k nearest neighbors in an index according to some distance metric. Feature engineering is used to extract, represent, and select the most distinguishing features of malware samples as a feature vector. Similarity between samples is defined as the inverse of a distance metric and used to find the neighborhood of a query vector. Historically, tree-based approaches have worked for splitting dense vectors into partitions but are limited to problems with low dimensionality. Locality sensitivity hashing attempts to map similar vectors into the same hash bucket. More recent advances make the use of k-nearest neighbor graphs that iteratively navigate between neighboring vertexes representing the samples.

The NN methods reviewed in this talk are evaluated using standard performance metrics and several malware datasets. Optimized ssdeep and selected NN methods are implemented in Rogers, an open source malware similarity tool, that allows analysts to process local samples and run queries for comparison of NN methods.

#### IntelliAV: Building an Effective On-Device Android Malware Detector

_Mansour Ahmadi_

"
The importance of employing machine learning for malware detection has become explicit to the security community. Several anti-malware vendors have claimed and advertised the application of machine learning in their products in which the inference phase is performed on servers and high-performance machines, but the feasibility of such approaches on mobile devices with limited computational resources has not yet been assessed by the research community, vendors still being skeptical. In this presentation, we aim to show the practicality of devising a learning-based anti-malware on Android mobile devices, first. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the significance of such a tool to cease new and evasive malware that can not easily be caught by signature-based or offline learning-based security tools. To this end, we first propose the extraction of a set of lightweight yet powerful features from Android applications. Then, we embed these features in a vector space to build an effective as well as efficient model. Hence, the model can perform the inference on the device for detecting potentially harmful applications. We show that without resorting to any signatures and relying only on a training phase involving a reasonable set of samples, the proposed system, named IntelliAV, provides more satisfying performances than the popular major anti-malware products. Moreover, we evaluate the robustness of IntelliAV against common obfuscation techniques where most of the anti-malware solutions get affected."

#### Chatting with your programs to find vulnerabilities

_Chris Gardner_

During the Cyber Grand Challenge, an automated vulnerability exploitation competition, all the teams used the same approach: use a fuzzer to find bugs, and symbolic execution to generate an exploit for any bugs found. Fuzzers are great at triggering bugs, but their effectiveness is often limited by the quality of the initial testcase corpus that is fed to them. Testcases are easy for humans to create, but hard to generate automatically. Teams used a wide variety of techniques to generate initial seeds: from using very slow symbolic execution techniques to find inputs that triggered execution paths, to just using the word “fuzz” as the seed and hoping for the best. However, many of the programs in the CGC are console programs designed to be used by humans: meaning they give a prompt in English and expect a response. For this research we trained a chatbot Recurrent Neural Network on a set of testcases generated by humans, and ran the RNN against the test set with the goal of finding testcases that had higher code coverage than random guessing and could be used with a fuzzer to find bugs.

Chris recently graduated from UMBC, where he found a passion for malware analysis and binary exploitation. In his spare time he plays CTFs and bikes his way around Washington DC.

#### Hunting the Ethereum Smart Contract: Color-inspired Inspection of Potential Attacks

_TonTon Huang_

Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies are gaining unprecedented popularity and understanding. Meanwhile, Ethereum is gaining a significant popularity in the blockchain community, mainly due to the fact that it is designed in a way that enables developers to write decentralized applications (Dapps) and smart contract. This new paradigm of applications opens the door to many possibilities and opportunities. However, the security of Ethereum smart contracts has not received much attention; several Ethereum smart contracts malfunctioning have recently been reported. Unlike many previous works that have applied static and dynamic analyses to find bugs in smart contracts, we do not attempt to define and extract any features; instead we focus on reducing the expert's labor costs. We first present a new in-depth analysis of potential attacks methodology and then translate the bytecode of solidity into RGB color code. After that, we transform them to a fixed-sized encoded imag​​e. Finally, the encoded image is fed to convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction and learning, detecting security flaw of Ethereum smart contract.

#### Beyond Adversarial Learning -- Security Risks in AI Implementations

_Kang Li_

A year after we discovered and reported a bunch of CVEs related to deep learning frameworks, many security and AI researchers have started to pay more attention to the software security of AI systems.   Unfortunately, many deep learning developers are still unaware of the risks buried in AI software implementations.  For example, by inspecting a set of newly developed AI applications, such as image classification and voice recognition, we found that they make strong assumptions about the input format used by training and classifications.  Attackers can easily manipulate the classification and recognition without putting any effort in adversarial learning.  In fact the potential danger introduced by software bugs and lack of input validation is much more severe than a weakness in a deep learning model.  This talks will show threat examples that produce various attack effects from evading classifications, to data leakage, and even to whole system compromises.  We hope by demonstrate such threats and risks, we can draw developers’ attention to software implementations and call for community collaborative effort to improve software security of deep learning frameworks and AI applications.

Kang Li is a professor of computer science and the director of the Institute for Cybersecurity and Privacy at the University of Georgia.  His research results have been published at academic venues, such as IEEE S&P, ACM CCS and NDSS, as well as industrial conferences, such as BlackHat, SyScan, and ShmooCon.  Dr. Kang Li is the founder and mentor of multiple CTF security teams, including SecDawg and Blue-Lotus.  He was also a founder and player of the Team Disekt, a finalist team in the 2016 DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge.

#### DeepPhish: Simulating the Malicious Use of AI

_Ivan Torroledo_

Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have become essential to any effective cyber security and defense strategy against unknown attacks. In the battle against cybercriminals, AI-enhanced detection systems are markedly more accurate than traditional manual classification. Through intelligent algorithms, detection systems have been able to identify patterns and detect phishing URLs with 98.7% accuracy, giving the advantage to defensive teams. However, if AI is being used to prevent attacks, what is stopping cyber criminals from using the same technology to defeat both traditional and AI-based cyber-defense systems? This hypothesis is of urgent importance - there is a startling lack of research on the potential consequences of the weaponization of Machine Learning as a threat actor tool. In this talk, we are going to review how threat actors could exponentially improve their phishing attacks using AI to bypass machine-learning-based phishing detection systems. To test this hypothesis, we designed an experiment in which, by identifying how threat actors deploy their attacks, we took on the role of an attacker in order to test how they may use AI in their own way. In the end, we developed an AI algorithm, called DeepPhish, that learns effective patterns used by threat actors and uses them to generate new, unseen, and effective attacks based on attacker data. Our results show that, by using DeepPhish, two uncovered attackers were able to increase their phishing attacks effectiveness from 0.69% to 20.9%, and 4.91% to 36.28%, respectively.

Ivan Torroledo is the lead data scientist in the Cyxtera Research organization.

#### AI DevOps: Behind the Scenes of a Global Anti-Virus Company's Machine Learning Infrastructure

_Alex Long_

"Thus far, the security community has treated machine learning as a research problem. The painful oversight here is in thinking that laboratory results would translate easily to the real world, and as such, not devoting sufficient focus to bridging that gap. Researchers enjoy the luxuries of neat bite-sized datasets to experiment upon, but the harsh reality of millions of potentially malicious files streaming in daily soon hits would-be ML-practitioners in the face like a tsunami-sized splash of ice water. And while in research there's no such thing as ""too much"" data, dataset sizes challenge real-world cyber security professionals with tough questions: ""How will we store these files efficiently without hampering our ability to use them for day-to-day operations?"" or ""How do we satisfy competing use-cases such as the need to analyze specific files and the need to run analyses across the entire dataset?"" Or maybe most importantly: ""Will my boss have a heart-attack when he sees my AWS bill?""

In this talk, we will provide a live demonstration of the system we've built using a variety of AWS services including DynamoDB, Kinesis, Lambda, as well as some more cutting edge AWS services such as Redshift and ECS Fargate. We will go into depth about how the system works and how it answers the difficult questions of real world ML such as the ones listed above. This talk will provide a rare look into the guts of a large-scale machine learning production system. As a result, it will give audience members the tools and understanding to confidently tackle such problems themselves and ultimately give them a bedrock of immediately practical knowledge for deploying large-scale on-demand deep learning in the cloud."

Alex Long is currently working as a programmer on the Sophos Datascience Team where he builds tools, scalable backends, and cool visualizations to support the team's research. His latest work has been on creating an online platform for researchers to publish, evaluate, and distribute their latest AI models, thus streamlining the process of productizing AI breakthroughs.

#### Generating Labeled Data From Adversary Simulations With MITRE ATT&CK 

_Brian Genz_

"Attackers have a seemingly endless arsenal of tools and techniques at their disposal, while defenders must continuously strive to improve detection capabilities across the full spectrum of possible vectors. The MITRE ATT&CK Framework provides a useful collection of attacker tactics and techniques that enables a threat-focused approach to detection. 

This technical talk will highlight key lessons learned from an internal adversary simulation at a Fortune 100 company that evolved into a series of data science experiments designed to improve threat detection. "

He brings experience in the defense intelligence, manufacturing, and financial sectors in the areas of incident response, digital forensics, vulnerability management, and security architecture consulting. He has presented at Derby Con, Circle City Con, CypherCon, the ISSA International Conference, ISACA, InfraGard, and other venues. Brian also serves as adjunct faculty in the information security program at Milwaukee Area Technical College. 

#### JMPgate: Accelerating reverse engineering into hyperspace using AI

_Rob Brandon_

"One of the most exciting potential applications for artificial intelligence and machine learning is cognitive augmentation of humans.  At its best, AI allows humans to handle more information, react faster to complex events, and potentially even sense features of the world that we are currently incapable of perceiving.  This has many applications in the security field, such as aiding humans in the task of binary reverse engineering.  Reverse engineering binary code is one of the most challenging skill sets in the security field to learn.  The ability to look at a block of raw machine code and understand what it does, as well as recognize similarities to code previously seen, often requires years spent doing tedious analysis of large amounts of code.    
In this talk I show how we can use machine learning to handle the tedious parts of this process for us.  If we show a generative neural network a wide variety of machine code, the network will learn the most relevant features needed to reproduce and describe that code.  Once the network is trained, we can show it a new segment of code and capture the state of the neurons at the end of the segment.  This neural state is effectively a summary of the entire sequence summarized into a vector.  
Comparing these vectors allows easy measurement of the similarity of several code sequences by simply measuring the Euclidean distance between them.  These vectors can also be used as inputs to other machine learning models that can perform a variety of tasks, such as identifying compiler settings used to generate the code.  As part of the presentation, I will also be releasing a tool, the JMPgate framework, which can be used to accomplish tasks like identifying library code within an executable binary.

#### Automated Planning for the Automated Red Team

_Andy Applebaum_

"Offensive assessments – i.e., penetration testing, adversary emulation, red teaming – have become a key component of maintaining a secure network. Unfortunately, offensive assessments require significant resources, and can vary in quality and structure based on who specifically is conducting the assessment. In the past few years, we’ve seen people try to remedy this problem by creating automated offensive assessment tools, but the capabilities and goals of these tools are highly variable, and many either require personnel to manage them or lack the ability to conduct dynamic or end-to-end tests.

We believe that automated offensive assessments can be done better using automated planning. One of the older branches of AI, automated planning seeks to solve problems where an autonomous agent must determine how to compose a sequence of actions together to achieve an objective. Problems in this space can range from constructing offline deterministic plans, to planning under probabilistic conditions, or to planning in scenarios where the world and underlying model are un- or partially-known. Planning techniques have been applied to solve problems in a variety of domains, including controlling unmanned vehicles and designing intelligent agents in computer games.

In this talk, we’ll describe how we’ve leveraged concepts from the automated planning community to help us design CALDERA, a free, open source automated adversary emulation system. Using these concepts, CALDERA dynamically strings techniques – taken from MITRE ATT&CK™ – together to achieve objectives and conduct end-to-end tests. In addition to describing CALDERA itself, we’ll also discuss more generally some of the challenges and advantages of deploying automated planning to automated offensive assessments, discussing alternate approaches that we as well as others have considered in tackling this problem. Attendees should walk away with both an understanding of how they can use CALDERA as well as how planning can be used for automated offensive assessments."

Andy Applebaum is a Lead Cyber Security Engineer at MITRE where he works on applied and theoretical security research problems, primarily in the realms of cyber defense, security automation, and automated adversary emulation. Andy has contributed to MITRE’s ATT&CK framework and CALDERA adversary emulation platform, as well as other projects within MITRE’s internal research and development portfolio.

#### Stop and Step Away from the Data: Rapid Anomaly Detection via Ransom Note File Classification

_Mark Mager_

"	
The proliferation of ransomware has become a widespread problem culminating in numerous incidents that have affected users worldwide. Current ransomware detection approaches are limited in that they either take too long to determine if a process is truly malicious or tend to miss certain processes due to focusing solely on static analysis of executables. To address these shortcomings, we developed a machine learning model to classify forensic artifacts common to ransomware infections: ransom notes. Leveraging this model, we built a ransomware detection capability that is more efficient and effective than the status quo.

I will highlight the limitations to current ransomware detection technologies and how that instigated our new approach, including our research design, data collection, high value features, and how we performed testing to ensure acceptable detection rates while being resilient to false positives. I will also be conducting a live demonstration with ransomware samples to demonstrate our technology's effectiveness. Additionally, we will be releasing all related source code and our model to the public, which will enable users to generate and test their own models, as we hope to further push innovative research on effective ransomware detection capabilities."

Throughout his career in software engineering and computer security, Mark has served in prominent technical leadership roles in the research and development of advanced computer network operations tools and has provided malware analysis and reverse engineering subject matter expertise to a diverse range of government and commercial clients in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.

#### Identifying and correlating anomalies in Internet-wide scan traffic to newsworthy security events

_Andrew Morris_

In this presentation, we will discuss using GreyNoise, a geographically and logically distributed system of passive Internet scan traffic collector nodes, to identify statistical anomalies in global opportunistic Internet scan traffic and correlate these anomalies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, large-scale DDoS attacks, and other newsworthy events. We will discuss establishing (and identifying any deviations away from) a "standard" baseline of Internet scan traffic. We will discuss successes and failures of different methods employed over the past six months. We will explore open questions and future work on automated anomaly detection of Internet scan traffic. Finally, we will provide raw data and a challenge as an exercise to the attendees. 

Andrew Morris is the founder and CEO of GreyNoise Intelligence, a DC-based cyber security company, and likely holds the world record for amount of time staring at Internet-wide scan traffic. Prior to founding GreyNoise, Andrew worked as a researcher, red team operator, and consultant for several large cyber security firms including Endgame, NCC group, and KCG. Outside of work, Andrew enjoys playing fingerstyle acoustic guitar and tries to figure out what his dreams mean. 

#### Machine Learning Model Hardening For Fun and Profit

_Ariel Herbert-Voss_

Machine learning has been widely and enthusiastically applied to a variety of problems to great success and is increasingly used to develop systems that handle sensitive data - despite having seen that for out-of-the-box applications, determined adversaries can extract the training data set and other sensitive information. Suggested techniques for improving the privacy and security of these systems include differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation. In this talk, we’ll take a look at the modern machine learning pipeline and identify the threat models that are solved using these techniques. We’ll evaluate the possible costs to accuracy and time complexity and present practical application tips for model hardening. I will also present some red team tools I developed to easily check black box machine learning APIs for vulnerabilities to a variety of mathematical exploits.

Ariel Herbert-Voss is a PhD student at Harvard University, where she specializes in deep learning, cybersecurity, and mathematical optimization. Like many machine learning researchers, she spent plenty of time thinking about deep learning from a computational neuroscience point of view without realizing that skulls make biological neural networks a lot less hackable than artificial ones. Now she thinks about securing deep learning algorithms and offensive applications.

#### The great power of AI: Algorithmic mirrors of society

_Aylin Caliskan_

"Following the progress in computing and machine learning algorithms as well as the emergence of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a reality impacting every fabric of our algorithmic society. Despite the explosive growth of machine learning, the common misconception that machines operate on zeros and ones, therefore they should be objective, still holds. But then, why does Google Translate convert these Turkish sentences with gender-neutral pronouns, “O bir doktor. O bir hemşire”, to these English sentences, “He is a doctor. She is a nurse”? As data-driven machine learning brings forth a plethora of challenges, I analyze what could go wrong when algorithms make decisions on behalf of individuals and society if they acquire statistical knowledge of language from historical human data.

In this talk, I show how we can repurpose machine learning as a scientific tool to discover facts about artificial and natural intelligence, and assess social constructs. I prove that machines trained on societal linguistic data inevitably inherit the biases of society. To do so, I derive a method that investigates the construct of language models trained on billions of sentences collected from the World Wide Web. I conclude the talk with future directions and open research questions in the field of ethics of machine learning."

Aylin Caliskan is an assistant professor of computer science at George Washington University. Her research interests include the emerging science of bias in machine learning and fairness, AI ethics, data privacy, and security. Her work aims to characterize and quantify aspects of artificial and natural intelligence using a multitude of machine learning and language processing techniques. In her recent publication in Science, she demonstrated how semantics derived from language corpora contain human-like biases. Prior to that, she developed novel privacy attacks to de-anonymize programmers using code stylometry.

#### GAN to the dark side: A case study of attacking machine-learning systems to empower defenses

_Li Chen_

"There has been a surge of interest in using machine learning (ML) to automatically detect malware through their dynamic behaviors. These approaches indeed have achieved much higher accurate detection rate and lower false positive rate. ML in threat detection has demonstrated to be a good cop to guard platform security. However should we fully trust ML-powered security? Here, we juxtapose the resiliency and trustworthiness of ML algorithms for security, in the case study of ransomware detection. We propose RD-Fool, an AI-based system to bypass ML-based ransomware detection. 

In this talk, we examine the perspectives of ML assuming the role of both a good cop and a bad cop. We first train a variety of deep learning and classical machine learning classifiers for ransomware detection using data collected from file I/O and registry events. We show the classifiers can achieve great performance in terms of classification accuracy and false positive rate for ransomware detection. Then we examine the resiliency of these classifiers using our proposed system RD-Fool. RD-Fool uses random forest and generative adversarial networks (GAN) to generate samples which can bypass the ransomware detectors. We demonstrate both exploratory and causative attacks using RD-Fool, where exploratory attack aims at bypassing the ransomware detector during inference phase, and causative attack aims at poisoning the training data to perturb the ML decision boundary.

The key advantages of RD-Fool include quick identification of the blind spots of the victim ML model and efficient generation of realistic and evasive samples. We examine the quality of the crafted sample using the perturbation distance and the Silhouette score. Our results and discoveries pose interesting and alarming issues such as how much should we trust or utilize ML for better security.

#### Towards a framework to quantitatively assess AI safety – challenges, open questions and opportunities. 

_Ram Shankar Siva Kumar_

While the papers are piling in arxiv on adversarial machine learning, and companies are committed to AI safety, what would a system that assess the safety of ML system look like in practice? Compare a ML system to a bridge under construction. Engineers along with regulatory authorities routinely and comprehensively assess the safety of the structure to attest the bridge’s reliability and ability to function under duress **before** opening it to the public. Can we as security data scientists provide similar guarantees for ML systems? This talk lays the challenges, open questions in creating a framework to quantitatively assess safety of ML systems. The opportunities, when such a framework is put to effect, are plentiful – for a start, we can gain trust with the population at large that ML systems aren’t brittle; that they just come in varying, quantifiable degrees of safety. 

Ram Shankar is a Data Cowboy on the Azure Security Data Science team at Microsoft, where his primary focus is modeling massive amounts of security logs to surface malicious activity. His work has appeared in industry  conferences like BlueHat, DerbyCon, MIRCon, Strata+Hadoop World Practice of Machine Learning as well as academic conferences like NIPS, IEEE Usenix, ACM - CCS.

#### Adversarial Patches

_Sven Cattell_

Adversarial examples that fool machine learning systems are a burgeoning field. Academics propose applications in fooling self driving cars or facial recognition systems. However, most of the techniques are useless in the real world. They require precise manipulations to the values of the pixels entering a system. Adversarial patches are an attack that could actually work. One can use them as a sticker on objects that one wants to obscure. This talk will cover how to make them and further applications.

I got my Ph.D. in algebraic topology in 2016 and immediately moved into machine learning to work on something useful to people. I then completed a post-doc in mathematical machine learning where I worked on medical data. I now work at Endgame as a data scientist.
